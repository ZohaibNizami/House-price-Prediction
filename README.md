# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques, specifically **Polynomial Regression**, to model complex relationships between property features and market prices. It provides a complete end-to-end solution — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment via a user-friendly web interface.
